# c-hello-world

> My first "Hello World!" in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).

Really, this example shows Unix `Timestamp` on terminal.  :smile:

## Usage

Compile `hello.c` file to binary:

```sh
$ cc hello.c -o hello
```

Run binary:

```sh
$ ./hello
```

Finally for each changes in `hello.c` only type:

```sh
$ make hello && ./hello
```

*Happy coding!* :+1:
